  <h2>About this site</h2>
  <p>
    This site builds on my previous JavaScript, TypeScript and frontend
    develpment experiences.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is built using Angular 20 and demonstrates several core concepts such as
    components, data binding, routing, and responsive design. It consists of
    four main pages
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>a home page,</li>
    <li>a calculator page,</li>
    <li>a unit converter page,</li>
    <li>and this project description page</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The site includes a fully functional navigation system using Angular Router,
    and all styling is done with structured CSS at both global and component
    levels.
  </p>
  <p>
    One component is also reused within the pages to demonstrate modular design.
    The project is version-controlled with Git, hosted on GitHub, and published
    on a public web host.

  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>
    I'm a developer with a long-time interest in modern fullstack web
    development. This project gave me hands-on experience with Angular’s
    component-based structure, routing system, and styling organization. I enjoy
    building responsive and functional web interfaces, and I'm continuously
    learning how to write clean, maintainable code and use tools like Git and
    GitHub to manage development workflows.
