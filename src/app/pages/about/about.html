  <h2>About this site</h2>
  <p>
    This site builds on my previous JavaScript, TypeScript and frontend
    develpment experiences.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is built using Angular 20 and demonstrates several core concepts such as
    components, data binding, routing, and responsive design. It consists of
    four main pages
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>a home page,</li>
    <li>a calculator page,</li>
    <li>a unit converter page,</li>
    <li>and this project description page</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The site includes a fully functional navigation system using Angular Router,
    and all styling is done with structured CSS at both global and component
    levels.
  </p>
  <p>
    Two Angular components have been implemented and reused across multiple
    pages to demonstrate modular design. The navigation component, which
    includes both the header and navbar, is used on every page for consistent
    navigation. Similarly, the footer component is reused to maintain consistent
    footer content across all pages. The project is version-controlled with Git,
    hosted on GitHub, and published on a public web host.

  <h2>My conclusions</h2>
  <p>
    During the development of My Angular Calculator & Converter Lab, I found the
    process of setting up routing and connecting each component to its
    respective route a bit repetitive. Defining routes for each page and
    component can be time-consuming, especially with multiple pages. That said,
    I see the value in Angular's modular structure, where each component is
    handled separately and can be reused. This makes the app more scalable and
    maintainable in the long run, even though the initial setup might feel
    repetitive. As I gain more experience with Angular, I expect this process to
    become more intuitive.
  </p>
  <p>
    Although this project gave me a good foundation, I recognize that I'm just
    beginning to scratch the surface of Angular’s full potential.

  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>
    I'm a developer with a long-time interest in modern fullstack web
    development. This project gave me hands-on experience with Angular’s
    component-based structure, routing system, and styling organization. I enjoy
    building responsive and functional web interfaces, and I'm continuously
    learning how to write clean, maintainable code and use tools like Git and
    GitHub to manage development workflows.
